* Install MingW (MinGW-3.1.0-1.exe). Use the default options
* Install MSys (MSYS-1.0.10.exe) (default options)
  - When you are done, a black post install console window will appea
  - Start post install -> y/y
  - type the path of mingw in the form c:/programme/mingw
  - It asks one more question about mount bindings, say yes

* Add gcc to the windows path. Do so over systemsteurung. It is c:\programme\mingw\bin
* Start mingw/msys and navigate to the ffmpeg directory. Use /c/ to go to c drive. Go to /current directory
* there should be a file called params.txt. It includes the commands. Type ./configure | params.txt
* If it is not there, type the following command:

./configure --enable-memalign-hack --enable-faac -extra-cflags=-I/C/Development/x86W

or

./configure --enable-memalign-hack --extra-cflags=-I/C/Mark/Development/erdmpeg/Packages/faac/include --extra-ldflags=-L/C/Mark/Development/erdmpeg/Packages/faac/libfaac/.libs --disable-static --enable-shared --enable-faac --disable-debug --disable-demuxers --disable-parsers --disable-decoders --enable-amr_nb


* Type make clean to clear out the old stuff
* Then type make
* if there is an faac error, change the path of the library and include headers for faac to point to the location of faac

To compile faac
---------------
I tried to compile it using msys from above, but it does not work
I tried also VS 6, but the project file does not open

- start cygwin program
- go to the individual package view
- select autoconf, automake and libtool and MAKE
- install app
- open newly installed cygwin
- type ./bootstrap. I had a warning about my_define
- when it is done, type ./configure
- then type 'make'
- it will finish with some errors, but the main files are all in .libs

FINALLY, I found the solution :D

Go to the .libs file, and copy the libfaac.a file into the C:\Programme\cygwin\lib directory
// ---------------------

* go to the ffmpeg directory and type make to compile ffmpeg

 no longer needed-
* Type ./configure --enable-shared --enable-memalign-hack --disable-debug
* If an error comes, delete the config.h file
* type make

1. Write the commands in a text file
2. Pipe it using ./configure | mpeg.txt
3. Add gcc to the path. It comes with cygwin
