The header files
-----------------
The interface of the Standard MPEG Encoder is provided in an 
automation compatible .tlb file. To add the headers, you will
have to import this file into your project.

For C++ developers
------------------
Add the following lines to your projects

#pragma warning(disable : 4192)
#import "DirectEncode.tlb" no_namespace, raw_interfaces_only exclude("UINT_PTR") 

For the CLSIDs, add the following line:
#include <StandardMPEGEncoderUIDs.h>

For C# and VB.NET developers
----------------------------
There is a file in the \Include directory called DirectEncodeNET.dll. This is a .NET assembly that contains reference to all the Standard MPEG Encoder types. Include this dll as a "Reference" to your project, and the definitions will become available. See the C# samples.

For VB6 developers
------------------
Add a reference to the .dll file in the VB6 references dialog. You can then access the interfaces. You can also use the IDirectEncodeVB interface
