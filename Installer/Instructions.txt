This version of the MPEG Encoder requires the Visual Studio 6 runtimes. It will run without additional dependencies on all windows versions greater than XP. If you wish to use on Windows 2000 or 98, you will need to install the VC6 redistributables.

The DirectEncode.dll file is the directshow filter, and the erdmpg-6.dll is the Mpeg Encoder library.
